# PhantomJS image

PhantomJS image built from sources (2.0.0) on Ubuntu 14.04.

This version also has Ruby 2.2.3 Installed on it too...

## Get the image

The image can be found on the MM docker registry (https://registry.mergermarket.it/phantomjs2/).

```
docker pull registry.mergermarket.it/phantomjs2:latest
```
## Usage

You may run it on the command line:

```
docker run -t â‰ˆ phantomjs --version
```

But you'll probably want to use it as a base image:

```
FROM registry.mergermarket.it/phantomjs2:latest
```
